Getting Started
--------------- 

* SwiftUI

```Swift
import SwiftUI

/// Step1: ðŸ˜™ import `Spotlight`
import Spotlight

struct ItemListView: View {
    @ObservedObject var viewModel: YOUR_VIEW_MODEL = YOUR_VIEW_MODEL()
    @State private var isSearching = false

    // MARK: - Body
    var body: some View {
    
        /// Step2: ðŸ˜† Declare `Spotlight` externally.
        Spotlight(searchKeywords:viewModel.searchableItems, // search keyword list as string array
                  isSearching:$isSearching,                 // Spotlight appears when true.
                  /// Step3: ðŸ˜Ž Whenever typing searching any keywords, and tap the suggested keywords,
                  /// those goes below. do your implementation as you need.
                  didChangeSearchText: { self.viewModel.searchText = $0 },
                  didTapSearchItem: { self.viewModel.searchText = $0 }) {
                    
                    /// Step4: ðŸ˜Ž Let's wrap SwiftUI Views in it, using trailing closure.
                    Text("Your View")
        }
    }
}
```

```

## Installation

There are three ways to use Spotlight in your project:
- using CocoaPods
- using Swift Package Manager
- manual install (build frameworks or embed Xcode Project)

### Installation with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries in your projects. See the [Get Started](http://cocoapods.org/#get_started) section for more details.

#### Podfile

First, 
```ruby
pod 'Spotlight'
```
then in your root project,
```ruby
pod install
```

### Installation with Swift Package Manager (Xcode 11+)

[Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) (SwiftPM) is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code as well as C-family dependency. From Xcode 11, SwiftPM got natively integrated with Xcode.

Spotlight support SwiftPM from version 5.1.0. To use SwiftPM, you should use Xcode 11 to open your project. Click `File` -> `Swift Packages` -> `Add Package Dependency`, enter [Spotlight repo's URL](https://github.com/boraseoksoon/Spotlight). Or you can login Xcode with your GitHub account and just type `Spotlight` to search.

After select the package, you can choose the dependency type (tagged version, branch or commit). Then Xcode will setup all the stuff for you.

If you're a framework author and use Spotlight as a dependency, update your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
let package = Package(
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/boraseoksoon/Spotlight", from: "0.1.1")
    ],
    // ...
)
```
